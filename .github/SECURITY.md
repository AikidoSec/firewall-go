# Reporting Security Issues

The Aikido team and community take security bugs in Zen seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, register on Intigriti and navigate to https://app.intigriti.com/researcher/programs/aikido/aikidozenbeta. If this program is not yet accessible to you feel free to open an issue on this repository and we will send you an invite.

The Intigriti team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
