    Protection from Local File Inclusion (LFI) Attacks

    All known functions that open files are susceptible to Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks. This aspect protects
    against LFI attacks by wrapping the `os.OpenFile` function with a security operation that will block the operation if
    it is deemed unsafe.

    Instrumenting only the `os.OpenFile` function is sufficient to protect against LFI attacks, as all other functions in
    the `os` package that open files ultimately call `os.OpenFile` (as of Go 1.23).
